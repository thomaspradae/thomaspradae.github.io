"excerpt:This right here is also part of the feeling. The feeling of going to bed knowing I need to finish this project by Sunday, in knowing that I must pull this out of the ether, bring this project into reality, bring myself into reality, bring who I want to be and do into reality": no one is coming to save you.

This right here is also part of the feeling. The feeling of going to bed knowing I need to finish this project by Sunday, in knowing that I must pull this out of the ether, bring this project into reality, bring myself into reality, bring who I want to be and do into reality: no one is coming to save you.

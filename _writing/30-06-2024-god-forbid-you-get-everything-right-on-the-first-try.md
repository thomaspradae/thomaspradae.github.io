It's not just about making it work, it's not just about the "finished project", it's not just about "showing your work", or better yet your "finished work". That's not what this is about, this is about learning. The good ol' "god forbid you get you everything right on the first try". What sense does it make if you hit a fluke, get everything right the first time and rob yourself of the process[^2], rob yourself of this sometimes slow paced, uncomfortable, grudging process of "embracing the suck". Yes, you suck. Yes, sucking sucks. Do you wish not to suck?[^3] Well, u know what to do. 


[^1]: ur telling me u guys don't use llms as therapists?
[^2]: Unless that's what you need and you just need the w, but that's not my case, that's not what this is about, I want to understand, I want to get this, I want to have a certain level of competence, will we need some flukes along the way? ofc. but I also want to rid myself of the feeling of "oh shit, if only they knew how bad things really are (concerning my competence)" I get when I go to sleep. 
[^3]: Once heard a line that went something like "no one learns faster than someone with no sense of embarrassment" ---> soon

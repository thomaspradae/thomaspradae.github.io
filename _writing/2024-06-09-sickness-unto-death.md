Consciousness vomit: I've been sick for the last few days. I had forgotten how it felt to be under the weather[^1]



I had forgotten how it felt to be under the weather. For most of these days there wasn't 


I've been sick for the last few days. This doesn't happen too often, so when it does, I've somehow forgot about how it feels to be under the weather. For most of the day there was not much on my mind, as they say, a healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man wants only one. My fever came at the worst possible time, or at least that's what I like to tell myself. I'll explain. I've had a lot of threads running in my head for quite some time now, I've thought of writing about them, but as usual, I don't. 

[^1]: I guess I don't really get sick that often, must be because I'm a pristine specimen (heavy sarcasm)

Forget the audience for a second. Forget the timeline. Just the two of us right now, we need to talk. I'm not sure I'll publish this one because I don't want you editing right now, I just want a good ol' consciousness spew, a good ol' 11pm rant, a good ol' it's a little too late for this one, but I need to get it out. I haven't been feeling it

excerpt: The code is pretty straight forward, we start off our simulation once a new point is generated, and we keep some track of time, I'm not sure how to fucking do this lol, as, I think we could maybe try and have discrete values, but the question might be how discrete, meaning, with each pass of time, and also, wondering, how time will pass, u see, when looking at the slider, this is basically what we need, but the thing is that how I see it, is that this is some sort of loop, and you keep it moving.

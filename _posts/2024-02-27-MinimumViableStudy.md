A huge thanks to Andrej Karpathy and MJ. 

If there's some class you really don't like[^1], and you recognize that the opportunity cost is too high (to the point where your head hurts each time you think about wasting just another second stuck in that chair[^2] , set apart some time that counts as a minimum viable study session. Set it so that you aim for a grade you're okay with, and once you hit your quota, let the struggle go, and focus on your shit. 

Minimum Viable Study

[^1]: As is common with me (since I studied economics and now have some regret in not having studied engineering)
[^2]: Come on it's not that bad lol.

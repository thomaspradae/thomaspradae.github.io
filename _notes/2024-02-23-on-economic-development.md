I can't remember what I did on this day two years ago and I don't know how to feel about that. In fact, I can barely recall what I did last Monday. And that which I can recall is just a small glimpse at what happened that day. I joked with a friend this past week that (this I do remember) 'The past doesn't exist.' Our minds can't be held accountable to remember each and every frame that flashes before our eyes. There are days, weeks, or maybe even complete years of my life that have completely disappeared, forever. You might argue, if it wasn't important, then there was no reason to remember it. Or that, in forgetting, we leave room only for that which is crucial, meant to be remembered. But how do you make peace with the fact that, so much of your life, is gone. 

For those who are busy, and will forget about these very words in a few minutes, I urge you one thing before you go: **Live fully.** Live like this very second, yes that one, the one that just passed, was rich enough in of itself. No one is watching you, no one is carefully directing your life as it flashes on a silver screen somewhere in some other reality - or if it is, I'll take this time to greet the audience: stick tight, I'll try to make the rest of the movie a lot better than what you've seen up to this point.

If we are to lose all perception of time when we die, then the universe might as well have ended the very instant you die, reaching its terminal state at once. Every single moment after your death, from your funeral, to the very last time someone murmurs your name, to the birth and death of the last human there ever was, will be the same to you. There is no legacy, there is no building an everlasting kingdom. Sure, you will live on in the hearts of a minute few, those are the ones that count I wish to argue. The textbooks, history books - cook books if you're lucky - let others wish to be included in these. I don't mean to not dream big, if you know anything about me, you know that am I'll for that, what I'm trying to say is that don't live for others, don't live to build a following or to have statues built in your memory. Focus on what you have now. The consciousness that flows through you, the seconds that will make up tomorrow morning, that despite your best effort, you won't remember in ten years. And while you won't remember this at all times, please take a time, every now and then, to remember that today won't go into a history book, it only existed now, it was only witnessed by you: a cosmological miracle, that woke up one day in the cosmos, and felt, lived, and was. 

Stop giving up your life to things you don't want or need. There's nothing new I presenting to you. Nothing you haven't heard before, but consider me a reminder, that you'll never be this young again, you'll never have a second chance at living today. So pls, as a promise to the young you, the dreamer in you, stop doing the shit you're not supposed to. And go give every day 110% of what you have. I love you dearly.

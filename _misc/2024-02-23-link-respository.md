excerpt: Becoming an adult is fucking hard. Becoming an adult is realizing I'm prone to running away from myself. From the piercing silence. Prone to run back into someone's or something's arms because the thought of being alone, in this very instance, neither past nor future, but this, this very instance. This one. is a little too unbearable. Because one hates oneself, and one's thoughts, one's sharp edges and ugly protuberances. Because one is coming out of a shell. One now realizes that one searches for that familiar embrace not for it's own sake, not for healthy company or being a part of something bigger, but because one feels broken, and seeks to be fixed by someone/something (or is there even a difference (?), I at least like to believe so). But you wont find it. Not a hug warm enough, or praise loud enough.
